## What is DuPont Analysis?

DuPont decomposes Return on Equity (ROE) into three components to reveal the drivers of profitability.

## The Formula

**ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage**

## Interpreting the Components

- **Net Profit Margin** — profits per dollar of revenue
- **Asset Turnover** — revenue generated per dollar of assets
- **Financial Leverage** — assets per dollar of equity
