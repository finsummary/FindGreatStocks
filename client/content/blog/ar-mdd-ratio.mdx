## What is the AR/MDD Ratio?

The Annual Return to Maximum Drawdown (AR/MDD) ratio measures how much return you get for each unit of risk, making it a powerful tool for comparing investments.

## Understanding Maximum Drawdown

Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is the largest peak‑to‑trough decline over a period. It shows the worst loss an investor would have experienced.

## Calculating AR/MDD Ratio

**Formula:** AR/MDD = Annual Return ÷ Maximum Drawdown

For example, with a 15% annual return and 10% maximum drawdown, AR/MDD = 1.5.

## Why AR/MDD Matters

- **Risk Adjustment:** Higher ratios indicate better risk‑adjusted returns
- **Comparison Tool:** Allows fair comparison across assets
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Helps find better risk‑reward combos
